Realistic Valley is more than a game. Our project bridges NASA’s agricultural datasets with farmers and communities to deepen understanding of sustainable farming. Our goal is to help farmers turn complex Earth science data into practical, eco-friendly decisions. Through two connected tools, we transform satellite data into accessible educational experiences that build lasting, data-driven agricultural knowledge:

# AgroScope 
A web application that connects to NASA’s POWER and Earth Science APIs to visualize four essential environmental parameters: humidity, temperature, precipitation, and solar irradiance, that directly impact crop health and yield.

# Realistic Valley
A Unity-based farming simulation game that incorporates these variables to model real-world farming conditions chosen through AgroScope. Crop growth is guided by an accurate plant growth model and informed by NASA’s Flood and Heat Data Pathfinder.

We hope to make NASA’s powerful agricultural data engaging and accessible, empowering farmers, students, and communities to better understand the changing climate and cultivate a more sustainable future.
